# EE337_Project

This was the end-term project for the course EE337: Microprocessors. <br>
I was assigned the project **Cricket Scoreboard Simulator on Pt-51**. The major points the project covered were as follows:
* Implemented a cricket scoreboard simulator for a 20 over game using Embedded C on the Keil software
* Interfaced the program with a keyboard connected to the Pt-51 board using Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) and the Flip software, 
  and tested it successfully on the Pt-51 board
